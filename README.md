# Starboard
Starboard is a transparent, topmost, click-through overlay that renders a single ImGui frame on top of Star Citizen. It exposes a plugin SDK + IPC bus so devs can build external tools (HUDs, panels, graphs) that render inside that shared frame. Because itâ€™s non-embedded and process-agnostic, it stays anti-cheat friendly.
