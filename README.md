# Starboard
Starboard is a transparent, topmost, click-through overlay that renders a single ImGui frame on top of Star Citizen. It will allow devs to build external tools (HUDs, panels, graphs) that render inside that shared frame. Because it’s non-embedded and process-agnostic, it stays anti-cheat friendly.
